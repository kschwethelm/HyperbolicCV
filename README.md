# Hyperbolic Computer Vision

Official PyTorch implementation of the paper [Hyperbolic Geometry in Computer Vision: A Novel Framework for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15919).

### We are working on releasing our code soon...

## Introduction

**TL; DR.** We present HCNN, the first fully hyperbolic CNN designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalize fundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of the convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression (MLR).
